# Continuous deployment test

Every app needs to be tested. A pipeline is no exception. This pipeline runs and tests the duvalhub/continuous-deployment pipeline suite. We will make a new "feature" and ensure that our change is built and deploy into every dev, uat and prod environment. For this purpose, we use [dummy test app](https://github.com/duvalhub/continuous-deployment-test-app).
